# Open Society

## Idea

Current state of a global common society is more or less constant, it doesn't evolve much (besides technology aspect), it hardly allows any changes to its model. In result, people in scope of such a society are stuck and conservated a way of their intercommunication, interaction, how they treat others and world around in general. Such model of course brought us to some point of mankind development, but still it is not a secret that is has major issues and problems in its core which can't be resolved from inside due to no such instruments and mechanisms.

Therefore, there is an idea to create slightly different model of society for these who accept it and will to join. We call it `Open Society`.

## Principles

- `TRUST` is a main resource that defines level of Legitimacy and Authority inside the society. Price for all kind of initiatives in scope of the society is additional trust. Every member should have particular level of trust that is visible for everyone. Trust is an indicator of weather person is usefull, honest, worthy etc based on his/her actions and feedbacks and can be changed accordingly. Low level of trust should be a red flag and a signal not to cooperate with a person, and not to provide society-specific services or goods. It is something like a money, but works a bit differently, and is a blood of a system.
- There can be a set of society-specific common services that may fullfill specific needs of a member if their trust level is high enough.
- Personal interests can be fulfilled by using common services or sending a specific request that can be resolved by other members. 
- Projects that are developed for a common needs won't have specific owners, but rather be owned by the society in general. 
- It is all about initiative to achieve common society goals, and `Initiators` together with `Volonteers` are those who make it happen.
- Whatever processes happening inside the society, wheather it is common service record, personal request, fund raising & money usage etc., it is all transparent and visible for every member. Every votings and polls are totally transparent, your vote is visible for everybody else and vice versa, always.
- Our society is based on set of "well known" (described here) agreements between its members and ideally should not depend on any system or records, but to make it more user friendly and secure we should use IT as an instrument to track all that stuff. In terms of security, our IT systems, services should always be open-sourced (with open code). Our batabases should also be open and visible for everyone. 

## Description

Taking into account issues of a current global common society, we tried to remove it from the beginning while planning `Open Society`. 

For example existing money are a way to value and trade, but it is also a source and a reason of bribes and crimes which lead to majority of all existing problems. Everything is spinning around money today. Money worth more than dignity, more than virtues and even more than a live. We propose a different approach to value not a servise or goods, but rather a person, based on his/her level of virtues, trust in particular. Those who we treat worthy - get services and goods. From other side, other members create a common service or produce goods, in return we treat them worthy as well, they have additional level of trust thus have access to even more services and goods.

Usually private business projects require investments, in return they pay ROI as an interest. Governments, from other side, forces people to pay taxes and desides how to distribute it, they can run services or launch new infrastructure proejcts, or simply can steal some money, sometimes even most of it. In our system - there are no such thing as taxes or investments with its ROI. Initiators initiate a specific project, they say what resources they need and how much money is needed. Members will donate it. If all the resources gathered - project starts. All donators know exactly what was payed and who payed, initiators and volunteers who run the project, give all financial-related information to the public.

Our Society values initiation, volunteering, supporters and donators that make things happen. And those will have most of benefits possible. Ideally, society-development circle should close when all services needed for regular life for all members are owned by the society, in result life would be possible without money at all.

## Roadmap

1 - Define, plan and document core features (in progress)
2 - Develop core IT services and systems
3 - Get first feedback & first participants

PS: We need to try to understand if it works, there is no other way.
